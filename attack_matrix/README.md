# MITRE ATT&CK matrix

Most of the  attack techniques contained in the repository's sysmon configuration are mapped to the [MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Main_Page).

The [MITRE corporation](https://www.mitre.org/) has developed a handy [ATT&CK navigator](https://github.com/mitre/attack-navigator) tool that can be used to easily navigate and annotate ATT&CK matrices. A [JSON file](attack_matrix/Sysmon-modular.json) is provided containing the full matrix of covered ATT&CK techniques that can be viewed in the [online navigator](https://mitre.github.io/attack-navigator/enterprise/). 

**This JSON is always kept up to date and contains the latest coverage matrix.** 

Viewing the matrix online is easy:
